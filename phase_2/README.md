# Data driven development

Once I have gained sufficient experience and established a strong foundation in software development, my aim is to transition my focus towards the Data Science aspect of programming.
As someone with a background in Data Science and Analytics, this is not unfamiliar teritory for me. The main benefit of this phase is familarizing myself with ML tools and technologies

## The focus includes:

### Languages:
1. Python (Primary): For data analysis, visualization and modeling 
  - Scikitlearn: For machine learning (ML)
  - Numpy: For working with arrays
  - Pandas: For orking with data frames and data transformation
  - Matplotlib: For data visualization 
  - Requests: For using APIs
  - OpenCV: For computer vision
  - NLTK: For text data
  - SpaCy: For text data
  - Keras (API): For deep learning (DL)
  - TensorFlow: For deep learning (DL)
2. R (Secondary): data analysis and modeling
  - Data.table: For data wrangling
  - Ggplot2: For data visualization 

### Visualization:
1. Tableau (Primary): For data visualization and dashboarding
2. PowerBI:  For data visualization and dashboarding

### Version control:
1. Git: For version control 

### Web frameworks
1. Streamlit: For building data web apps
2. Panel: For building data dashboards
