# Career_path
This is a repo to showcase my transition from a fullstack Software Engineer to Data Science and finally becoming a Machine learning and Artificial intelligence Engineer. I will try and document all the relavent knowledge I'm going to learn along the way

## My focus will include:

### Languages:
1. **Python**: This will be my primary language as it is the most versitile and it can be used in all 3 phases
  - Matplotlib: For data visualization 
  - Requests: For using APIs
  - OpenCV: For computer vision
2. **Javacript**: This will be my secondary language that will be used mostly in the first phase
3. **R**: This will be a backup langugaes in my second and possibly third phase as well
  - Data.table: For data wrangling
  - Ggplot2: For data visualization 

### Frameworks:
#### Phase 1
1. **Flask**: For simple and minimalist web development projects 
2. **Django**: For more professional web development projects
3. **Node**: For web backnend development
4. **React*: For web frontend development
5. **TypeScript**: For strict JavaScript coding practices
#### Phase 2 & 3
7. **scikitlearn**: For machine learning (ML)
8. **Numpy**: For working with arrays
9. **Pandas**: For orking with data frames and data transformation
10. **Keras** (API): For deep learning (DL)
11. **SciPy**: For statistical modeling, data visualization, and Machine learning
12. **PyTorch**:  For deep learning (DL)
13. **TensorFlow**: For deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML)
14. **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For text data
15. **SpaCy**: For text data

### Visualization:
1. Tableau (Primary): For data visualization and dashboarding
2. PowerBI:  For data visualization and dashboarding

### Version control:
1. Git: For version control 

### Web frameworks:
1. Streamlit: For building data web apps
2. Panel: For building data dashboards

### Databases:
1. **MySQL**: Maily for phase 1 & 2 
2. **MongoDB**: For all phases
3. **Spark**: Maily for phase 2 & 3
4. **Hadoop**: Maily for phase 2 & 3

### Cloud services:
1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: 
2. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:
3. **Microsoft cloud computing platform (Azure)**:

## Overall skills required 
1. 1 - 2 programming langugaes
2. Relavent frameworks required in each phase
3. Mathematical and Statsistical modeling
6. Working with small - big data
4. Deep learning
5. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, libraries and platforms
7. Working with cloud services
8. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
9. Neural Networks
