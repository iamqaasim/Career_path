# Career_path
This is a repo to showcase my transition from a fullstack Software Engineer to Data Science and finally to becoming a Machine learning and Artificial intelligence Engineer. I will try and document all the relavent knowledge I'm going to learn along the way

## My focus will include:

### Languages:
1. **Python**: This will be my primary language as it is the most versitile and it can be used in all 3 phases
  - Matplotlib: For data visualization 
  - Requests: For using APIs
  - OpenCV: For computer vision
2. **Javacript**: This will be my secondary language that will be used mostly in the first phase
3. **R**: This will be a backup langugaes in my second and possibly third phase as well

### Frameworks:
#### Phase 1
1. **Flask**: For simple and minimalist web development projects 
2. **Django**: For more professional web development projects
3. **Node**: For web backnend development
4. **React*: For web frontend development
5. **TypeScript**: For strict JavaScript coding practices
### Phase 2 & 3
7. **scikitlearn**: For machine learning (ML)
8. **Numpy**: For working with arrays
9. **Pandas**: For orking with data frames and data transformation
10. **Keras** (API): For deep learning (DL)
11. **SciPy**: For statistical modeling, data visualization, and Machine learning
12. **PyTorch**:  For deep learning (DL)
13. **TensorFlow**: For deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML)
14. **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For text data
15. **SpaCy**: For text data

### Databases
