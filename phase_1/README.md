# Sharpen my skills

Over the next 1-4 years, my primary objective is to enhance my existing skillset through both work experience and personal projects. I'm focusing much of my time in this phase becasue I want to make sure I have a solid foundation in both understanding and experience.

## The focus includes:

### Languages and Frameworks
1. Python (Primary)
  - Flask: for simple and minimalist projects 
  - Django: for more professional projects
2. Javacript (Secondary)
  - Node: for web backnend development
  - React: for web frontend development
  - TypeScript: for strict JS coding

### Databases
1. MongoDB: For handling document-oriented data, big data, and real-time applications
2. MySQL: For handling relational data, transactions, and e-commerce applications.
3. Redis: The focus is on the caching aspect

### User data
How to handle and manage sensitive user data in a secure manner
