# Machine learning and Artificial intelligence

With a solid foundation and over five years of experience in core programming concepts, I am ready to transition into the field of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). My primary focus will be on AI automation and its applications towards sustainable living. Much of my time will be in this phase as it want to fully gasp the concepts and apply its application.

## The focus includes:

### Languages:
1. Python: For Data analysis, visualization, modeling, Deep learning and  Machine learning 
  - scikitlearn: For machine learning (ML)
  - Requests: For using APIs
  - OpenCV: For computer vision
  - NLTK: For text data
  - SpaCy: For text data
  - Keras (API): For deep learning (DL)
  - TensorFlow: For deep learning (DL)

### Skills Required
1. Python
2. ML algorithms
3. ML libraries
4. ML platforms
5. Mathematical and Statsistical models
6. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
7. Deep learning
8. Neural Networks
9. Big data: Spark, Hadoop, MongoDB
10. Cloud services: AWS, GCP, Azure
