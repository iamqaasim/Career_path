# Machine learning and Artificial intelligence

With a solid foundation and over five years of experience in core programming concepts, I am ready to transition into the field of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). My primary focus will be on AI automation and its applications towards sustainable living.

## The focus includes:

### Languages:
1. Python: For data analysis, visualization and modeling 
  - scikitlearn: For machine learning (ML)
  - Requests: For using APIs
  - OpenCV: For computer vision
  - NLTK: For text data
  - SpaCy: For text data
  - Keras (API): For deep learning (DL)
  - TensorFlow: For deep learning (DL)

### Skills Requirmd
1. Python
2. ML algorithms
3. ML libraries
4. ML platforms
5. Mathematical and Statsistical models
6. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
7. Deep learning
8. Neural Networks
9. Big data: Spark, Hadoop, MongoDB
10. Cloud services: AWS, GCP, Azure
